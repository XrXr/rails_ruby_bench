For awhile I tried to keep a reasonable graphing solution in
here. Unfortunately, "graphing time data" very quickly turns into a
general graphing package, which I do not want to write or maintain.

You can see my specific individual graphing attempts in the repository
"https://github.com/noahgibbs/rrb_datavis", which contains both my
collected data and my data visualization for RRB-based talks and blog
posts. It includes a number of examples of graphing the results,
especially using the D3 JavaScript visualization library.
